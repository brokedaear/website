# Broke Da EAR!

Official website for Broke Da EAR! sounds.

## Getting Started

Ensure that `nix` is installed on your computer. [Determinate System's Nix](https://docs.determinate.systems/getting-started/) is recommended, especially for Mac systems. After installation, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
nix develop
```

This command will create the development environment. Use this shell to carry on with development, as it contains all the necessary dependencies and tooling required to make this project work in development. **Do not use your system shell**.
